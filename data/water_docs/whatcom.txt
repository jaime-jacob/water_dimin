REPORT
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
On June 12, 1989, Oxy Corporation applied to the Department of Ecology for an industrial use and fire protection water right to appropriate
116 gpm for industrial use and fire protection. The water right application was assigned number G1-25463.
On November 15, 1990, water permit G1-25463P was issued to Oxy Corporation. The permit was approved for withdrawal of 116 gpm and
92.8 acre-feet per year from three wells in the NW 1/4, NE 1/4, Section 7, T39N, R2E, W.M.
On July 8, 1993, the Department of Ecology accepted a change application from Public Utility District No. 1 of Whatcom County. This
change application requested to change the place of use and add an additional point of withdrawal/diversion from a pond.

INVESTIGATION
In considering this application, my investigation included, but was not limited to research and/or review of:
The State Water Code
The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Comments
Washington State Department of Health Comments
Existing water rights on file for Whatcom PUD #1 Water System
Records of other water rights in the vicinity
Notes from site visit on March 22, 2005
Correspondence from Mr. Steve Boessow at the Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife
Topographic and local area maps
2004 Comprehensive Water System Plan for PUD No. 1 of Whatcom County
Legal description for new Place of Use for Grandview-Northgate service area provided on October 26, 2006
A letter from the PUD's counsel to Ecology written on August 11,2006 relating the history of the project
A letter from the PUD's counsel to Ecology written on August 2006 relating to extension of the original permit development schedule
State Water Code
Chapters 90,03 and 90.44 RCW authorize the appropriation of public water for beneficial use and describe the process for obtaining water
rights including the process to amend or change existing rights. Laws specifically governing the water right permitting process are RCW
90.03.250 through 90.03.340 and RCW 90.44.060. Changes or amendments to these rights are covered primarily under RCW 90.03.380 and
RCW 90.44.100.
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FOR CHANGE

G1-25463P
State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
This water right change application is categorically exempt under SEPA WAC 197-11-305 and WAC 197-11-800(4).
Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Comments
A copy of this change application was sent to the Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for their review. On March 30, 2005, the
Department of Ecology received a letter from the WDFW stating that, "California Creek is a highly productive coho stream worthy of
protection and restoration. Since this proposal does not withdraw additional water above the original water right WDFW waives comment on
this application."
Existing Rights for the Water System
There are currently seven water rights held by the PUD #1 (Table 1) as per their 2004 Water System Plan.

Other Water Rights in the Vicinity
In addition to those water rights held by the PUD #1 of Whatcom County, there are 15 water right certificates, zero water right permits, and 61
water right claims in Sections 6 and 7 in Township 39 North, Range 2 East and Sections I and 12 in Township 39 North, Range I East. These
are listed below. There are also approximately 105 exempt water wells in the same legal delineation. It is likely that some wells counted as
exempt here are actually associated with water right claims in Table 3. The true extent of the water right represented by a water right claim
can only be determined in a county superior court in a general water right adjudication. Since this area has not been adjudicated, the extent of
the water rights under claims listed in Table 3 is not known.

Site Visit
The site visit was conducted on March 22, 2005. Present were Mr. Tom Anderson, general manager of the Whatcom PUD #1, Andrew Dunn,
hydrogeologist with this office, and myself. We first observed the new point of withdrawal, which consists of a seven foot diameter well
connected to an adjacent spring-fed pond via gravel filtration. The well is situated in a pumphouse, and there are two pumps in the well. The
first primary pump had an indicated capability of 1760 gpm at 250 horsepower, but the applicant indicated the pump is actually capable of
3000 gpm. The second smaller pump (15 horsepower) is present to keep the system pressurized The pond is located next to California creek,
separated from it by a large berm. There is an overflow channel, through which water flows into the creek when water in the pond exceeds a
certain level.
Wells 1, 3 and 4 were also visited. See Hydrogeology section for more details about existing and new points of withdrawal.
Topographic and Local Area Maps
The Bertrand Creek USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic map, dated 1972, and maps provided by the applicant were used during this
investigation.
2004 Comprehensive Water System Plan
Chapter six of the PUD's most recent water system plan contains water resource and water right data, and was used for this report.

HYDROGEOLOGY
The following information is taken from the Hydrogeologic Report for Change Application G1-25463 by Andrew Dunn, staff
hydrogeologist. Table and figure numbers herein refer to those in this section only:
Background
On July 8, 1993, the Department of Ecology received a change application submitted by the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom
County to change ground water permit GI-25463P. This water right change application requests to add a pond as an additional point of
withdrawal The proposed pond is located in the SW 1/4, SW % Section 6, Township 39N, Range 2E, W.M., Whatcom County,
Washington, which is in WRIA I.
On March 22, 2005, Paul Fabiniak (Ecology report writer) and I (Ecology hydrogeologist) performed a site visit to the area during
which we met with Tom Anderson, Manager of the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County.
Geographic Setting of the Grandview Area, Whatcom County, Washington
The site is located at an elevation of approximately 60 to 110 feet above sea level in the headwaters of the California Creek watershed.
The site is located on the base of the northeastern edge of the Mountain View Upland The highest point on the upland, located to the
southwest of the site, is approximately 360 feet above sea level.
Point of Withdrawal/Diversion Construction
Table / describes the wells and the structure at the pond that has been used or is proposed to be used to withdraw water under this water
right. The location of all wells and the pond can be seen in the figure on page one of this ROE.

Well / (Unique well ID AGK-350) is used to provide potable water to the buildings within the industrial park for domestic and industrial
uses. The water is pumped from the well, treated with chlorine, piped to a 30,000 gallon storage tank, and then routed through some
pressure tanks before being released into the distribution system. Tom Anderson indicated that the chlorine treatment is required due to
the long residence time in the storage tank. Well I was approved as a point of withdrawal in the original report of examination and 116
gpm and 92.8 acre-feet per year was approved for industrial use. This well has a water meter installed that read 21,777,000 gallons on
the date of the site visit. On the power box inside the pump house it documented that the pumping rate for this well had been measured at
93.6 gpm on both March 30, 2001 and April 6. 2004.
Wells 3 and 4 are approximately 5 feet apart and are located within the same pump house. Well 3 is used to keep the fire suppression
system "charged" at the correct operating pressure. Well 4 will provide the system with the rate of flow necessary when actively fighting
a fire in the industrial park, if they should need it. The original report of examination for GI-25463 (10/3/1990) indicated that Well 4
could pump at a rate of approximately 2100 gpm. Wells 3 and 4 were approved as points of withdrawal in the original report of
examination along with their use for fire protection. However, the only limit given on the water right document was for the Industrial
use. In case of a fire, any rate or quantity of water can be used to put the fire out During the site visit we could not measure the depth to
water, but someone had documented the depth to static water level (a) 39 feet below the top of the casing on April 29, 1991, by writing it
on the face of the pressure gage. Neither Well 3 nor Well 4 has a water meter installed
Tom Anderson expressed Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County's desire to have the pond approved as a point of withdrawal
under their water right. Their thinking was that if an Industrial user did not require potable water for their process, then the pond water
could be used out of the fire protection pipes for that purpose. This would reduce the demand on the potable water system and would also
reduce the amount of chlorine that they need to use.
The point of withdrawal/diversion at the pond represents the gray area between surface water and ground water rights. One ground
water certificate (GI-26325C) already exists for the pond at the same location as the proposed withdrawal/diversion, When the pond was
originally excavated I do not believe that it was directly connected to California Creek However, a man-made change to the location of
California Creek and tributary streams now directly connects the pond to the stream network The structure that the pumps are
completed in is actually an 84 inch diameter concrete easing constructed at the edge of the pond Gravel was imported and placed
around the casing to filter the water. So, water moves from the pond through the gravel filter and into the large diameter casing before
being pumped into the fire protection or proposed water distribution system. Hydrogeologically the withdrawal/diversion structure is
similar to a shallow well being drilled next to a surface water body.
California Creek Surface Water Basin
The California Creek watershed is approximately 22.8 square miles in size. California Creek itself has a total length of approximately 9
miles (Division of Water Resources, 1960). California Creek drains to the northwest into the saltwater of Drayton Harbor, just south of
the City of Blaine and the Canadian border.
California Creek is inhabited by coho salmon and resident game and non-game fish (Boessow, 2005).
The minimum flow documented at the gage site prior to 1960 was 0.33 ofs measured on August 19, 1958. For the 1954 irrigation season
the lowest flow measured was 0.8 ofs (Division of Water Resources, 1960).
The Department of Ecology has established a manual staff gage for California Creek just downstream of Valley View Road (SE 1/a. SE 1/4,
Section 27, T40N, RIE, W.M.). Unfortunately, a rating curve has not been developed for this site, due to vegetation growth in the stream
channel, so the stage height can not accurately be correlated to a stream discharge. The most recent stage measured for this site was
3.96 feet on March I, 2005. The drainage area feeding the creek upstream of this stream gage is approximately 11 square miles in size
and the elevation of the stream gage is approximately 15 feet above sea level (Division of Water Resources, 1960). Since the newly
collected data does not convert the stage to a discharge, I am unsure how the current measurements compare to the older 1950s era
data.
From the assembled data it appears that the lowest flows in California Creek typically occur during August and the highest flows occur
during the winter months.
The pond that is proposed as a point of withdrawal is currently connected to California Creek A spring-fed stream flows to the north off
of the Mountain View Upland before entering the pond at its southeastern end The pond has an overflow structure to the northwest of
the proposed withdrawal/diversion structure that allows water from the pond to flow directly into California Creek At the time of the site
visit a beaver had constructed a dam at the overflow structure, which raised the water level in the pond by approximately one foot,
making the pond surface elevation approximately 3 to 4 feet higher than the level of California Creek adjacent to the pond. It is unknown
if the pond discharges directly to the creek all year round or if the water level in the pond drops in the summer and eliminates surface
outflow. The close proximity of the pond and California Creek combined with the higher water level elevation of the pond suggests that
in addition to any surface water flow, ground water seepage from the pond also discharges into the creek
All of the original points of withdrawal and the proposed pond are all located within the California Creek subbasin as defined by the
WRIA / watershed planning group (2001) (Figure 2).

Hydrogeology of the Grandview Area, Whatcom County, Washington
The two geographic settings described above also have different geologic features that influence the ground water hydrology. The two
different settings are the Mountain View Upland and the Custer Trough. The Custer Trough contains a thin unconfined aquifer consisting
of sand that was deposited as distal glacial outwash by the glacier that advanced and retreated during the Sumas Stade (Cax and Kahle,
1999). The Sumas outwash overlies a very thick (several hundred feet) sequence of glaciomarine drift or marine silt and clay dominated
deposits. Most wells in the Custer Trough tap ground water in the Sumas outwash aquifer.

The Mountain View Upland consists of glacial and non-glacially derived deposits as described in Table 2. Most wells in this part of the
upland, including the three Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County, withdraw water from the unconfined to confined sand and
gravel aquifer / have referred to as the Vashon Advance Outwash and Didricksen (1997) referred to as the Deming Sand.
Didricksen (1997) created three cross sections that run through the area containing all of the wells and the pond relating to this change
application. The cross sections of interest are A-4', B-B: and F-F* (Appendix B). Didricksen identifies that the geologic units contained
on the Mountain View Upland Portion of the site consists primarily of Bellingham Drift (unit Qb) (glaciomarine drift) overlying Deming
Sand (unit Qd) (fluvial deposit). She also shows a thin layer of a unit she calls "Sand & Gravel over Drift" (unit Qbg) which occurs
above the Bellingham Drift on the lower elevations of the Mountain View Upland Within the Custer Trough, Didricksen identifies that
the thin "Outwash Sand and Gravel" (unit Qso) is found at the ground surface and is underlain by the Bellingham Drift and possibly the
Deming Sand
Didricksen's Deming Sand unit is what I have referred to as the Vashon Advance Outwash Either way the name of the unit is less
important than its composition, which is defined above and can be seen in the well logs and cross sections in Appendices A through C.
Aquifer Recharge
The aquifer(s) tapped by all of the original points of withdrawal are recharged by infiltration of water on the Mountain View Upland.
Ground Water Flow Directions
Ground water generally flows from higher areas of the Mountain View Upland toward the lower-lying area that contains California and
Dakota Creeks and is referred to as the Custer Trough (Figure 1). Ground water captured by the original wells under this water right
would naturally discharge to California Creek if it had not been captured Ground water flow is not fully contained within one aquifer,
but instead moves between different aquifers and through aquitards.
The pond is located slightly downstream from where the ground water naturally flowing past the original points of withdrawal would
likely discharge to the stream network
Ground Water Levels over Time
Using the limited water level information that exists for the original points of withdrawal, it appears that the ground water levels have
not declined or increased significantly since the wells were drilled (Table 1).
Aquifer Testing
No aquifer testing was performed or deemed necessary for this change application.
Conclusions for Water Right Hydrogeologic and Hydrologic Assessment
Since this report is being prepared for a change to an existing ground water right, the hydrogeologic questions posed in RCW 90.03.380
and RCW 90.44.100 that must be answered by the Department of Ecology are as follows:
1. Is the proposed point of diversion and original points of withdrawal within the same source of water?
2.
Will approval of this water right impair any existing water right holders?
3. Will approval of this water right change be detrimental to the public welfare?
Same Source of Water
The original wells and the proposed pond are considered to be water within the same source for the following reasons:
I. The wells and pond are all located within the California Creek subbasin as defined by the WRIA / watershed planning group.
2. The wells and pond are located in relatively close proximity, within 4250 feet of each other.
3.
The water level elevation of the pond is similar to the static water level elevation measured in the wells.
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FOR CHANGE

G1-25463P
4.
Ground water captured by the original wells would naturally discharge to California Creek Water captured at the proposed
pond would naturally discharge to California Creek, either as surface water or as ground water seepage.
Impairment Analysis
Allowing the water right holder to pump water from the edge of the pond as opposed to pumping entirely from the three existing wells
will not impair any water right holders for the following reasons:
I.
Pulling some water from the pond will actually shift some of the streamflow reduction of California Creek a little downstream
compared to pumping from the existing wells.
2.
No water right holder, other than the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County relies on the pond as the source of water
from exercise of their water rights.
3.
The nearest certificated downstream appropriator diverting surface water from California Creek is located over 7200 feet
downstream.
4.
The nearest documented ground water certificate is located approximately 2000 feet from the pond and no other water wells
were seen in close proximity to the pond during the site visit.
Public Interest
No detriment to the public interest could be identified during this hydrogeologic investigation that would result from approval of this
water right application.
Recommendations
Based on the conclusions of this report, feel that hydrogeologically this application can be approved However, if there are other
factors that require the application to be denied, it must be denied regardless of the hydrogeologic conclusions.
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FINDINGS
In accordance with state law, the following considerations must be addressed during the process of evaluating this change request:
The following tests must be addressed when processing a request for a change in point of withdrawal and place of use:
Is water available at the new point of withdrawal/diversion?
Will the change create an enlargement of the original right?
Does the additional point of withdrawal/diversion tap the same body of public ground water as the original point(s) of withdrawal?
Will the change cause impairment to other existing rights?
Will the public interest be impaired?
What are the protestors concerns?
Water Availability
Based upon observations of the capabilities of the new well and characteristics of the adjacent pond during the field exam, in conjunction
with the hydrogeologic assessment made above, it can be concluded that water is available at the new point of withdrawal/diversion for
the specified quantities.
Potential for Enlargement
This investigation has determined that Groundwater Permit G1-25463P is in good standing. Adding the additional point of
withdrawal/diversion will not result in an enlargement of the right because no additional water beyond that approved for the permit will
be withdrawn from any combination of the new and original sources. Therefore, approval of this change will not result in the
enlargement of groundwater permit G1-25463P.
Same Body of Public Ground Water
Based upon the information and analysis provided in the hydrogeologic assessment above, it can be concluded that the new point of
withdrawal/diversion is in the same body of public groundwater as the original points of withdrawal.
Impairment of Other Rights
As stated in the hydrogeologic assessment above, no impairment of other rights will occur upon approval of this change.
Public Interest
No detriment to the public interest could be identified during the investigation of this application for change. The change is not speculative in
nature, as it is occurring as part of an ongoing project.
Protests
No protests were received during the statutory 30-day protest period.
DISCUSSION
Based upon the detailed history provided by the applicant, the development of the permit has been pursued with due diligence, and reasonable
progress is being made in fulfilling the original intent of the project. This detailed history is provided in a letter from counsel for the PUD
dated August 11, 2006. It contains a detailed account of development of the Grandview Light Industrial Zone and surrounding property from
1989 to August of 2006. From the outset, the intention of the original applicant, Oxy Corporation, was to connect their water system to the
neighboring Jantzen system and allow the Whatcom PUD #1 to acquire and run the project as a water district. This information served as a
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FOR CHANGE

G1-25463P
basis for determining that the place of use expansion is not an enlargement of the intent of the project. This letter will be permanently included
in the file for future reference.
RECOMMENDATIONS
I recommend the request for change to G1-25463P be approved, subject to the provisions listed below:
The amount of water granted is a maximum limit that shall not be exceeded and the water user shall be entitled only to that amount of
water within the specified limit that is beneficially used and required.
Metering Provision:
An approved measuring device shall be installed and maintained for each diversion/withdrawal of the sources identified by this
water right in accordance with the rule "Requirements for Measuring and Reporting Water Use", Chapter 173-173 WAC.
Water use data shall be recorded weekly. The maximum annual instantaneous rate of diversion/withdrawal and the annual total
volume shall be submitted to Ecology by January 31st of the following year.
The following information shall be included with each submittal of water use data: owner, contact name if different, mailing
address, daytime phone number, Permit/Certificate/Claim No., source name, volume including units, Department of Health
WFI water system number and source number(s) (for public drinking water systems), and well tag number (for ground water
withdrawals). In the future, Ecology may require additional parameters to be reported or more frequent reporting. Ecology
prefers web based data entry, but does accept hard copies. Ecology will provide forms and electronic data entry information.
Chapter 173-173 WAC describes the requirements for data accuracy, device installation and operation, and information
reporting. It also allows a water user to petition Ecology for modifications to some of the requirements. Installation, operation
and maintenance requirements are enclosed as a document entitled "Water Measurement Device Installation and Operation
Requirements".
Department of Ecology personnel, upon presentation of proper credentials, shall have access at reasonable times, to the records
of water use that are kept to meet the above conditions, and to inspect at reasonable times any measuring device used to meet the
above conditions.
Proof of Appropriation:
The water right holder shall file the notice of Proof of Appropriation of water (under which the certificate of water right is
issued) when the permanent distribution system has been constructed and the quantity of water required by the project has been
put to full beneficial use. The certificate will reflect the extent of the project perfected within the limitations of the superseding
permit. Elements of a proof inspection may include, as appropriate, the source(s), system instantaneous capacity, beneficial
use(s), annual quantity, place of use, and satisfaction of provisions.
Water Level Monitoring:
In order to protect the resource, static water level (SWL), represented by depth to water for existing and replacement wells shall
be measured at least once each month. Measurements shall be taken after the pump has been shut off a reasonable time to allow
water level to return to normal. Ecology's Water Resources program (NWRO) shall be notified if a below normal seasonal drop
is measured in SWL, otherwise this data shall be maintained and be made available to Ecology upon request.
Well Decommissioning
Any approved points of withdrawal under this water right that are no longer planned to be used shall be properly decommissioned
within a reasonable amount of time.
CONCLUSIONS
In accordance with chapters 90.03 and 90.44 RCW, I conclude that ground water permit G1-25463P is in good standing and is eligible for
change. I have determined that the change to GI-25463P will not enlarge the permit and the water use will be beneficial. Approval of this
change request will not cause impairment of existing rights or be detrimental to the public interest, Based on these conclusions, this change
request should be approved subject to existing rights and the above-indicated provisions and a superseding permit should be issued.

REPORT
BACKGROUND INFORMATION
On June 12, 1989, Oxy Corporation applied to the Department of Ecology for an industrial use and fire protection water right to appropriate
116 gpm for industrial use and fire protection. The water right application was assigned number G1-25463.
On November 15, 1990, water permit G1-25463P was issued to Oxy Corporation. The permit was approved for withdrawal of 116 gpm and
92.8 acre-feet per year from three wells in the NW 1/4, NE 1/4, Section 7, T39N, R2E, W.M.
On July 8, 1993, the Department of Ecology accepted a change application from Public Utility District No. 1 of Whatcom County. This
change application requested to change the place of use and add an additional point of withdrawal/diversion from a pond.

INVESTIGATION
In considering this application, my investigation included, but was not limited to research and/or review of:
The State Water Code
The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Comments
Washington State Department of Health Comments
Existing water rights on file for Whatcom PUD #1 Water System
Records of other water rights in the vicinity
Notes from site visit on March 22, 2005
Correspondence from Mr. Steve Boessow at the Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife
Topographic and local area maps
2004 Comprehensive Water System Plan for PUD No. 1 of Whatcom County
Legal description for new Place of Use for Grandview-Northgate service area provided on October 26, 2006
A letter from the PUD's counsel to Ecology written on August 11,2006 relating the history of the project
A letter from the PUD's counsel to Ecology written on August 2006 relating to extension of the original permit development schedule
State Water Code
Chapters 90,03 and 90.44 RCW authorize the appropriation of public water for beneficial use and describe the process for obtaining water
rights including the process to amend or change existing rights. Laws specifically governing the water right permitting process are RCW
90.03.250 through 90.03.340 and RCW 90.44.060. Changes or amendments to these rights are covered primarily under RCW 90.03.380 and
RCW 90.44.100.
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FOR CHANGE

G1-25463P
State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
This water right change application is categorically exempt under SEPA WAC 197-11-305 and WAC 197-11-800(4).
Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife Comments
A copy of this change application was sent to the Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) for their review. On March 30, 2005, the
Department of Ecology received a letter from the WDFW stating that, "California Creek is a highly productive coho stream worthy of
protection and restoration. Since this proposal does not withdraw additional water above the original water right WDFW waives comment on
this application."
Existing Rights for the Water System
There are currently seven water rights held by the PUD #1 (Table 1) as per their 2004 Water System Plan.

Other Water Rights in the Vicinity
In addition to those water rights held by the PUD #1 of Whatcom County, there are 15 water right certificates, zero water right permits, and 61
water right claims in Sections 6 and 7 in Township 39 North, Range 2 East and Sections I and 12 in Township 39 North, Range I East. These
are listed below. There are also approximately 105 exempt water wells in the same legal delineation. It is likely that some wells counted as
exempt here are actually associated with water right claims in Table 3. The true extent of the water right represented by a water right claim
can only be determined in a county superior court in a general water right adjudication. Since this area has not been adjudicated, the extent of
the water rights under claims listed in Table 3 is not known.

Site Visit
The site visit was conducted on March 22, 2005. Present were Mr. Tom Anderson, general manager of the Whatcom PUD #1, Andrew Dunn,
hydrogeologist with this office, and myself. We first observed the new point of withdrawal, which consists of a seven foot diameter well
connected to an adjacent spring-fed pond via gravel filtration. The well is situated in a pumphouse, and there are two pumps in the well. The
first primary pump had an indicated capability of 1760 gpm at 250 horsepower, but the applicant indicated the pump is actually capable of
3000 gpm. The second smaller pump (15 horsepower) is present to keep the system pressurized The pond is located next to California creek,
separated from it by a large berm. There is an overflow channel, through which water flows into the creek when water in the pond exceeds a
certain level.
Wells 1, 3 and 4 were also visited. See Hydrogeology section for more details about existing and new points of withdrawal.
Topographic and Local Area Maps
The Bertrand Creek USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic map, dated 1972, and maps provided by the applicant were used during this
investigation.
2004 Comprehensive Water System Plan
Chapter six of the PUD's most recent water system plan contains water resource and water right data, and was used for this report.

HYDROGEOLOGY
The following information is taken from the Hydrogeologic Report for Change Application G1-25463 by Andrew Dunn, staff
hydrogeologist. Table and figure numbers herein refer to those in this section only:
Background
On July 8, 1993, the Department of Ecology received a change application submitted by the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom
County to change ground water permit GI-25463P. This water right change application requests to add a pond as an additional point of
withdrawal The proposed pond is located in the SW 1/4, SW % Section 6, Township 39N, Range 2E, W.M., Whatcom County,
Washington, which is in WRIA I.
On March 22, 2005, Paul Fabiniak (Ecology report writer) and I (Ecology hydrogeologist) performed a site visit to the area during
which we met with Tom Anderson, Manager of the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County.
Geographic Setting of the Grandview Area, Whatcom County, Washington
The site is located at an elevation of approximately 60 to 110 feet above sea level in the headwaters of the California Creek watershed.
The site is located on the base of the northeastern edge of the Mountain View Upland The highest point on the upland, located to the
southwest of the site, is approximately 360 feet above sea level.
Point of Withdrawal/Diversion Construction
Table / describes the wells and the structure at the pond that has been used or is proposed to be used to withdraw water under this water
right. The location of all wells and the pond can be seen in the figure on page one of this ROE.

Well / (Unique well ID AGK-350) is used to provide potable water to the buildings within the industrial park for domestic and industrial
uses. The water is pumped from the well, treated with chlorine, piped to a 30,000 gallon storage tank, and then routed through some
pressure tanks before being released into the distribution system. Tom Anderson indicated that the chlorine treatment is required due to
the long residence time in the storage tank. Well I was approved as a point of withdrawal in the original report of examination and 116
gpm and 92.8 acre-feet per year was approved for industrial use. This well has a water meter installed that read 21,777,000 gallons on
the date of the site visit. On the power box inside the pump house it documented that the pumping rate for this well had been measured at
93.6 gpm on both March 30, 2001 and April 6. 2004.
Wells 3 and 4 are approximately 5 feet apart and are located within the same pump house. Well 3 is used to keep the fire suppression
system "charged" at the correct operating pressure. Well 4 will provide the system with the rate of flow necessary when actively fighting
a fire in the industrial park, if they should need it. The original report of examination for GI-25463 (10/3/1990) indicated that Well 4
could pump at a rate of approximately 2100 gpm. Wells 3 and 4 were approved as points of withdrawal in the original report of
examination along with their use for fire protection. However, the only limit given on the water right document was for the Industrial
use. In case of a fire, any rate or quantity of water can be used to put the fire out During the site visit we could not measure the depth to
water, but someone had documented the depth to static water level (a) 39 feet below the top of the casing on April 29, 1991, by writing it
on the face of the pressure gage. Neither Well 3 nor Well 4 has a water meter installed
Tom Anderson expressed Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County's desire to have the pond approved as a point of withdrawal
under their water right. Their thinking was that if an Industrial user did not require potable water for their process, then the pond water
could be used out of the fire protection pipes for that purpose. This would reduce the demand on the potable water system and would also
reduce the amount of chlorine that they need to use.
The point of withdrawal/diversion at the pond represents the gray area between surface water and ground water rights. One ground
water certificate (GI-26325C) already exists for the pond at the same location as the proposed withdrawal/diversion, When the pond was
originally excavated I do not believe that it was directly connected to California Creek However, a man-made change to the location of
California Creek and tributary streams now directly connects the pond to the stream network The structure that the pumps are
completed in is actually an 84 inch diameter concrete easing constructed at the edge of the pond Gravel was imported and placed
around the casing to filter the water. So, water moves from the pond through the gravel filter and into the large diameter casing before
being pumped into the fire protection or proposed water distribution system. Hydrogeologically the withdrawal/diversion structure is
similar to a shallow well being drilled next to a surface water body.
California Creek Surface Water Basin
The California Creek watershed is approximately 22.8 square miles in size. California Creek itself has a total length of approximately 9
miles (Division of Water Resources, 1960). California Creek drains to the northwest into the saltwater of Drayton Harbor, just south of
the City of Blaine and the Canadian border.
California Creek is inhabited by coho salmon and resident game and non-game fish (Boessow, 2005).
The minimum flow documented at the gage site prior to 1960 was 0.33 ofs measured on August 19, 1958. For the 1954 irrigation season
the lowest flow measured was 0.8 ofs (Division of Water Resources, 1960).
The Department of Ecology has established a manual staff gage for California Creek just downstream of Valley View Road (SE 1/a. SE 1/4,
Section 27, T40N, RIE, W.M.). Unfortunately, a rating curve has not been developed for this site, due to vegetation growth in the stream
channel, so the stage height can not accurately be correlated to a stream discharge. The most recent stage measured for this site was
3.96 feet on March I, 2005. The drainage area feeding the creek upstream of this stream gage is approximately 11 square miles in size
and the elevation of the stream gage is approximately 15 feet above sea level (Division of Water Resources, 1960). Since the newly
collected data does not convert the stage to a discharge, I am unsure how the current measurements compare to the older 1950s era
data.
From the assembled data it appears that the lowest flows in California Creek typically occur during August and the highest flows occur
during the winter months.
The pond that is proposed as a point of withdrawal is currently connected to California Creek A spring-fed stream flows to the north off
of the Mountain View Upland before entering the pond at its southeastern end The pond has an overflow structure to the northwest of
the proposed withdrawal/diversion structure that allows water from the pond to flow directly into California Creek At the time of the site
visit a beaver had constructed a dam at the overflow structure, which raised the water level in the pond by approximately one foot,
making the pond surface elevation approximately 3 to 4 feet higher than the level of California Creek adjacent to the pond. It is unknown
if the pond discharges directly to the creek all year round or if the water level in the pond drops in the summer and eliminates surface
outflow. The close proximity of the pond and California Creek combined with the higher water level elevation of the pond suggests that
in addition to any surface water flow, ground water seepage from the pond also discharges into the creek
All of the original points of withdrawal and the proposed pond are all located within the California Creek subbasin as defined by the
WRIA / watershed planning group (2001) (Figure 2).

Hydrogeology of the Grandview Area, Whatcom County, Washington
The two geographic settings described above also have different geologic features that influence the ground water hydrology. The two
different settings are the Mountain View Upland and the Custer Trough. The Custer Trough contains a thin unconfined aquifer consisting
of sand that was deposited as distal glacial outwash by the glacier that advanced and retreated during the Sumas Stade (Cax and Kahle,
1999). The Sumas outwash overlies a very thick (several hundred feet) sequence of glaciomarine drift or marine silt and clay dominated
deposits. Most wells in the Custer Trough tap ground water in the Sumas outwash aquifer.

The Mountain View Upland consists of glacial and non-glacially derived deposits as described in Table 2. Most wells in this part of the
upland, including the three Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County, withdraw water from the unconfined to confined sand and
gravel aquifer / have referred to as the Vashon Advance Outwash and Didricksen (1997) referred to as the Deming Sand.
Didricksen (1997) created three cross sections that run through the area containing all of the wells and the pond relating to this change
application. The cross sections of interest are A-4', B-B: and F-F* (Appendix B). Didricksen identifies that the geologic units contained
on the Mountain View Upland Portion of the site consists primarily of Bellingham Drift (unit Qb) (glaciomarine drift) overlying Deming
Sand (unit Qd) (fluvial deposit). She also shows a thin layer of a unit she calls "Sand & Gravel over Drift" (unit Qbg) which occurs
above the Bellingham Drift on the lower elevations of the Mountain View Upland Within the Custer Trough, Didricksen identifies that
the thin "Outwash Sand and Gravel" (unit Qso) is found at the ground surface and is underlain by the Bellingham Drift and possibly the
Deming Sand
Didricksen's Deming Sand unit is what I have referred to as the Vashon Advance Outwash Either way the name of the unit is less
important than its composition, which is defined above and can be seen in the well logs and cross sections in Appendices A through C.
Aquifer Recharge
The aquifer(s) tapped by all of the original points of withdrawal are recharged by infiltration of water on the Mountain View Upland.
Ground Water Flow Directions
Ground water generally flows from higher areas of the Mountain View Upland toward the lower-lying area that contains California and
Dakota Creeks and is referred to as the Custer Trough (Figure 1). Ground water captured by the original wells under this water right
would naturally discharge to California Creek if it had not been captured Ground water flow is not fully contained within one aquifer,
but instead moves between different aquifers and through aquitards.
The pond is located slightly downstream from where the ground water naturally flowing past the original points of withdrawal would
likely discharge to the stream network
Ground Water Levels over Time
Using the limited water level information that exists for the original points of withdrawal, it appears that the ground water levels have
not declined or increased significantly since the wells were drilled (Table 1).
Aquifer Testing
No aquifer testing was performed or deemed necessary for this change application.
Conclusions for Water Right Hydrogeologic and Hydrologic Assessment
Since this report is being prepared for a change to an existing ground water right, the hydrogeologic questions posed in RCW 90.03.380
and RCW 90.44.100 that must be answered by the Department of Ecology are as follows:
1. Is the proposed point of diversion and original points of withdrawal within the same source of water?
2.
Will approval of this water right impair any existing water right holders?
3. Will approval of this water right change be detrimental to the public welfare?
Same Source of Water
The original wells and the proposed pond are considered to be water within the same source for the following reasons:
I. The wells and pond are all located within the California Creek subbasin as defined by the WRIA / watershed planning group.
2. The wells and pond are located in relatively close proximity, within 4250 feet of each other.
3.
The water level elevation of the pond is similar to the static water level elevation measured in the wells.

G1-25463P
4.
Ground water captured by the original wells would naturally discharge to California Creek Water captured at the proposed
pond would naturally discharge to California Creek, either as surface water or as ground water seepage.
Impairment Analysis
Allowing the water right holder to pump water from the edge of the pond as opposed to pumping entirely from the three existing wells
will not impair any water right holders for the following reasons:
I.
Pulling some water from the pond will actually shift some of the streamflow reduction of California Creek a little downstream
compared to pumping from the existing wells.
2.
No water right holder, other than the Public Utility District No. / of Whatcom County relies on the pond as the source of water
from exercise of their water rights.
3.
The nearest certificated downstream appropriator diverting surface water from California Creek is located over 7200 feet
downstream.
4.
The nearest documented ground water certificate is located approximately 2000 feet from the pond and no other water wells
were seen in close proximity to the pond during the site visit.
Public Interest
No detriment to the public interest could be identified during this hydrogeologic investigation that would result from approval of this
water right application.
Recommendations
Based on the conclusions of this report, feel that hydrogeologically this application can be approved However, if there are other
factors that require the application to be denied, it must be denied regardless of the hydrogeologic conclusions.
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FINDINGS
In accordance with state law, the following considerations must be addressed during the process of evaluating this change request:
The following tests must be addressed when processing a request for a change in point of withdrawal and place of use:
Is water available at the new point of withdrawal/diversion?
Will the change create an enlargement of the original right?
Does the additional point of withdrawal/diversion tap the same body of public ground water as the original point(s) of withdrawal?
Will the change cause impairment to other existing rights?
Will the public interest be impaired?
What are the protestors concerns?
Water Availability
Based upon observations of the capabilities of the new well and characteristics of the adjacent pond during the field exam, in conjunction
with the hydrogeologic assessment made above, it can be concluded that water is available at the new point of withdrawal/diversion for
the specified quantities.
Potential for Enlargement
This investigation has determined that Groundwater Permit G1-25463P is in good standing. Adding the additional point of
withdrawal/diversion will not result in an enlargement of the right because no additional water beyond that approved for the permit will
be withdrawn from any combination of the new and original sources. Therefore, approval of this change will not result in the
enlargement of groundwater permit G1-25463P.
Same Body of Public Ground Water
Based upon the information and analysis provided in the hydrogeologic assessment above, it can be concluded that the new point of
withdrawal/diversion is in the same body of public groundwater as the original points of withdrawal.
Impairment of Other Rights
As stated in the hydrogeologic assessment above, no impairment of other rights will occur upon approval of this change.
Public Interest
No detriment to the public interest could be identified during the investigation of this application for change. The change is not speculative in
nature, as it is occurring as part of an ongoing project.
Protests
No protests were received during the statutory 30-day protest period.
DISCUSSION
Based upon the detailed history provided by the applicant, the development of the permit has been pursued with due diligence, and reasonable
progress is being made in fulfilling the original intent of the project. This detailed history is provided in a letter from counsel for the PUD
dated August 11, 2006. It contains a detailed account of development of the Grandview Light Industrial Zone and surrounding property from
1989 to August of 2006. From the outset, the intention of the original applicant, Oxy Corporation, was to connect their water system to the
neighboring Jantzen system and allow the Whatcom PUD #1 to acquire and run the project as a water district. This information served as a
REPORT OF EXAMINATION FOR CHANGE

G1-25463P
basis for determining that the place of use expansion is not an enlargement of the intent of the project. This letter will be permanently included
in the file for future reference.
RECOMMENDATIONS
I recommend the request for change to G1-25463P be approved, subject to the provisions listed below:
The amount of water granted is a maximum limit that shall not be exceeded and the water user shall be entitled only to that amount of
water within the specified limit that is beneficially used and required.
Metering Provision:
An approved measuring device shall be installed and maintained for each diversion/withdrawal of the sources identified by this
water right in accordance with the rule "Requirements for Measuring and Reporting Water Use", Chapter 173-173 WAC.
Water use data shall be recorded weekly. The maximum annual instantaneous rate of diversion/withdrawal and the annual total
volume shall be submitted to Ecology by January 31st of the following year.
The following information shall be included with each submittal of water use data: owner, contact name if different, mailing
address, daytime phone number, Permit/Certificate/Claim No., source name, volume including units, Department of Health
WFI water system number and source number(s) (for public drinking water systems), and well tag number (for ground water
withdrawals). In the future, Ecology may require additional parameters to be reported or more frequent reporting. Ecology
prefers web based data entry, but does accept hard copies. Ecology will provide forms and electronic data entry information.
Chapter 173-173 WAC describes the requirements for data accuracy, device installation and operation, and information
reporting. It also allows a water user to petition Ecology for modifications to some of the requirements. Installation, operation
and maintenance requirements are enclosed as a document entitled "Water Measurement Device Installation and Operation
Requirements".
Department of Ecology personnel, upon presentation of proper credentials, shall have access at reasonable times, to the records
of water use that are kept to meet the above conditions, and to inspect at reasonable times any measuring device used to meet the
above conditions.
Proof of Appropriation:
The water right holder shall file the notice of Proof of Appropriation of water (under which the certificate of water right is
issued) when the permanent distribution system has been constructed and the quantity of water required by the project has been
put to full beneficial use. The certificate will reflect the extent of the project perfected within the limitations of the superseding
permit. Elements of a proof inspection may include, as appropriate, the source(s), system instantaneous capacity, beneficial
use(s), annual quantity, place of use, and satisfaction of provisions.
Water Level Monitoring:
In order to protect the resource, static water level (SWL), represented by depth to water for existing and replacement wells shall
be measured at least once each month. Measurements shall be taken after the pump has been shut off a reasonable time to allow
water level to return to normal. Ecology's Water Resources program (NWRO) shall be notified if a below normal seasonal drop
is measured in SWL, otherwise this data shall be maintained and be made available to Ecology upon request.
Well Decommissioning
Any approved points of withdrawal under this water right that are no longer planned to be used shall be properly decommissioned
within a reasonable amount of time.
CONCLUSIONS
In accordance with chapters 90.03 and 90.44 RCW, I conclude that ground water permit G1-25463P is in good standing and is eligible for
change. I have determined that the change to GI-25463P will not enlarge the permit and the water use will be beneficial. Approval of this
change request will not cause impairment of existing rights or be detrimental to the public interest, Based on these conclusions, this change
request should be approved subject to existing rights and the above-indicated provisions and a superseding permit should be issued.
