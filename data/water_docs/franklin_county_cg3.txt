Introduction
William and Cinda Middleton of Pasco, Washington filed the above application for change/transfer of water
right with the Franklin County Water Conservancy Board (FCWCB). The FCWCB accepted the application;
thence the Spokane office of the Department of Ecology; and, public notice was made in accordance with
RCW 90.03.280. No letters of protest or request for intervener status were received during the thirty-day
protest period associated with said publication. In addition, a public meeting was duly advertised and held on
June 27, 2002 in Whitman County, as required. This Report of Examination, Findings and Recommendations
contains information constituting a Technical Analysis; substantiation for a Record of Decision; content for a
Certificate of conditional Approval; and, was prepared to support decision-making pursuant to said
application. The following information was obtained from the applicant, individuals with relevant personal
knowledge, review of Department of Ecology records, analysis of pertinent data and one field examination of
the area of concern.
Background
Ground Water Certificate No. 2844 issued June 28, 1957 with a priority date of March 26, 1957; in the
amounts of 1,050 gallons per minute (gpm); up to 480 acre-feet per year (af/yr) for the seasonal irrigation of
120 acres.
The permit was issued for one well in the SW 1/4 of Sec 21 within T 19 N., R. 40 E.W.M. of Whitman County.
The Certificate owner has used subject water upon lands owned by their family with the principal crop being
alfalfa. The original Water Right Certificate was issued in the name of Glorfield and Mills. However,
ownership interest in the Place of Use (POU), other than Ben Glorfield, was reported by Jack and Bernice
Glorfield, who did execute an assignment transferring all of their rights and interest in the prior pending
change filing over to Ben J. Glorfield on May 14, 1998 thereby having a deferral of interest to Ben Glorfield as
a matter of record with the non-consummated change approval dated November 10, 1999.
Prior to this current Application for Change/Transfer of POU and POW's filed by William and Cinda Middleton
with regard to their conditional interest in GWC 2844 owned by Ben Glorfield, Mr. Glorfield did, on November
8, 1994, file an application to change subject Purpose of Use from seasonal Irrigation to Commercial Use. No
action was taken on this filing until November 10, 1999, when a conditional approval was granted with a
development schedule extending to December 1, 2007. No action to implement this change has been
effected by Mr. Glorfield; therefore, this approved change with attendant conditions related to Trust Water
Rights and Hillis Rule would be null and void when the Glorfield to Middleton change is approved. Said
Report of Examination considered this possibility and stated, in part, that:
"If the application for change is not perfected then the application for change will be
canceled and the Certificate will return to its original place, purpose and season of use
the applicant is advised to continue irrigating the 120 acres "
Mr. Glorfield has continued said irrigation through the 2001 season and has concurred with applicant
Middletons in the requested change to the Place of Use (POU) owned by the applicant and to change from the
one Glorfield well to Middleton's integrated system to include five wells. The Purpose of Use would remain as
seasonal irrigation.
Approval of this proposed change would constitute the clear intent of the Glorfields to not perfect the project
contemplated under the November 10, 1999 conditional approval.

No. 2844
Updated: 06/02

Investigation and related policy
Requested Change/Transfer: The application for change/transfer proposes to change the Glorfield POW from
one well in Whitman County in recognized hydraulic continuity with Surface Waters (Springs, wetlands and
seeps) which are directly or indirectly tributary to Packer Creek (see Ecology's Hydrogeologist James M Lyerla
statement in his 11/10/99 Findings associated with the non-executed Change from Irrigation to Commercial
use under said GWC 2844, pg. 3, that it is likely that there is some degree of interconnection between this
(Glorfield) well and local surface water sources."); thence, in Surface Water continuity through
Packer Creek, a recognized fifth order stream which is tributary to Rock Creek, which is tributary to the
Palouse River, which is tributary to the Snake River, which is tributary to the Columbia River (Lake Wallula-
McNary Pool), a recognized first order stream with a normal pool surface water elevation of 340' msl for
documentation of this chain of continuity; thence, the Middleton wells A, 1, 2, 7 and B have wellhead
elevations in the range of 480' msl +/-, static water levels of 385+/- with a test pump level of 365+/- with
screens beginning as low as 305' msl (Well 2) or 35' below the normal level of Lake Wallula. The regional
groundwater source for the Middleton wells is in hydraulic continuity with said Lake Wallula as indicated on a
cross-section which runs due north from Snake River Mile 2.6 for 3.5+ miles. The five wells involved are
located both East (wells B, 7 and A) and West (wells 1 and 2) of this transect and are in the same general
regional groundwater setting per said cross-section.
Current State policy in this regard flows from administrative actions allowing Changes as between surface and
ground waters or ground and surface waters, so long as hydraulic continuity exists in at least one direction. In
the Glorfield to Middleton case, this test is met throughout this proposed change. The administrative policy is
based generally on a series of court decisions from John Plakos et al V. Ecology and the Hubbard Bros. V.
Ecology through the Postema case which serve as the underpinning of the "one-molecule" approach to
continuity as between surface and ground, or ground and surface waters. Measurability of the degree of
continuity has not been required, just the likely, or in some cases, possible, continuity relationship between
the ground water and surface water involved.
No change in purpose of use is requested: this is an irrigation-to-irrigation change.
The transfer does not involve any increase in the amount of water pumped as provided under GWC-2844.
The effect of the transfer will be to withdraw the water from multiple wells in an integrated system in hydraulic
continuity with the Columbia River McNary pool (Lake Wallula) instead of one well in hydraulic continuity with
Packer Creek located upstream and over 1,300' higher in elevation and to apply this water at the Middleton
POU over 90 miles downstream from the Glorfield POU.
Demonstrated Use
Water has been continuously used as indicated by various power records over the years. The guidance
currently provided in administering changes (RCW 90.03.380) is that the estimated or actual consumptive
use of the average of the two highest of the last five years is eligible for change. An analysis of monthly data
from the State of Washington Irrigation Guide for Colfax for alfalfa is that 31.14 inches of water are needed
for crop use. When this need is modified by the effective rainfall at the Glorfield farm (el. 1,820) for 1997
2001 data from U. S. G. S. Water-Resources Investigations Report 88-4105 (prorated from St. John at el.
1945' msl and Ritzville at el. 1,830' msl) the following annual crop need for the last five years is derived (see
Table 1, attachment T):
1997
1998
1999
2000
2001
25.02"
25.08"
26.10"
25.07"
26.54"
When 1999 and 2001 (26.10" and 26.54") are averaged the need is 26.32".
The total consumptive need demand of 26.32" with a 70% efficient system (reasonable efficiency for the
Glorfield irrigation system-wheel and hand move) yields 37.6 inches per year or 376 acre feet per year
available to transfer for the 120 acres.
It is noted that GWC 2844 provides for up to 480 acre-feet/year with documented past use of up to 457 acre-
feet/year (1977 drought year) on the Glorfield POU.
There was prior concurrence with Ecology Hydrogeologist Jim Lyerla that all applied water would be consumed
by the crop at a lower level of use under prior standards and that no deep percolation or surface runoff would
occur from the field, so full consumption use was assumed then. The current analysis is conservative in
nature and uses the referenced documentation for the "estimated" 376 acre-feet per year available to
transfer for the 120 acres. It is noted that both the years used under the current standard are later than, and
not included in, the earlier assessment done under a different (earlier Statutory) standard. It is reasonable to
assume that the full 376 acre-feet per year represent the consumptive use amount and that no return flow
occurs.
For purposes of the change/transfer application, the valid, transferable right under GWC 2844 is reasonably
represented by an amount of up to the full allotment of 1,050 gpm, 376 af/yr. for seasonal irrigation of 120
acres.

Place of Use.
The requested new Places of Use (POU) is owned by the Applicant and are described as follows:
Parcel 1.
The E 1,000 ft. of the SE 1/4 section 15, T9N, R30EWM
Containing approximately 40 acres;
And,
Parcel 2.
That portion of Section 23, Township 9 North, Range 30 East, W.M., Franklin County,
Washington, more particularly described as follow;
Beginning at the point of intersection with the Southerly right of way line of Pasco/Kahlotus Road and
the West line of said Section 23; thence Northeasterly along said Southerly right of way line 750 feet
to the True Point of Beginning; then Southeasterly at right angles to said right of way line 1,000 feet;
thence Northeasterly parallel to and distant 1,000 feet from said Pasco/Kahlotus Road to the
Intersection with the Westerly boundary line of said Smith Canyon Wasteway as described in Deed to
the United States of America, recorded July 14, 1964, under Auditor's File No. 262947, thence
Northerly along said Westerly boundary line to the Southerly right of way line of said Pasco/Kahlotus
Road; thence Southwesterly along said right of way line to the Point of Beginning.
Containing approximately 92 acres.
Middleton's Places Of Use for 120 acres irrigation are within the approximately 132 acres in parcels 1 and 2.
Potential Conflict.
There is no conflict created by the change/transfer, as no greater consumptive use of water will occur in the
Snake River basin from the proposed change.
Moreover, in excess of 90 stream miles will benefit from an incremental additional flow from the proposed
change, as would certain associated wetlands as noted in the aforementioned provisional change, which has
not been implemented. This incremental additional flow will be proportionally greater in Packer Creek than in
Rock Creek and get proportionally less through the Palouse, Snake and, thence, the Columbia Rivers. While
this change would not effect a measurable increase in the Rivers involved, measurability in fact is not the
standard now in place in Washington State. No net theoretical diminishment of flow in the associated Rivers
will occur by this proposed change.
Local ground waters exhibit no known conflicts with other water rights as 20 years of Static Water Levels
(SWL) in Well #3 (8" monitoring well) observed by the USBR indicated a range of Mean Sea Level (MSL) 368'
and 386' with a normative annual fluctuation of about 7' with no declining trend. The nearby production well
(#2) has a SWL of 372'; a Pumping Water Level (PWL) of 352' with screening from MSL 302' - 312' and MSL
322' - 342'; and, the McNary Pool elevation range of 336' - 342', or, basically 30' of screening is at or below
the upper level of McNary Pool.
Impairment Analysis.
The effect of the transfer is to move the water withdrawal from the existing single Point of Withdrawal (POW)
to five Points of Withdrawal (POW's) over 90 miles downstream and over 1,300 feet lower in elevation as
proposed would not be detrimental to existing Surface or Ground Water Rights
An impairment analysis for the transfer decision just evaluates whether existing water rights will be impaired
due to the transfer in well location. The two Well Logs noted in Attachments "0" of the associated Technical
report dated June 6, 2002 along with the analysis noted under Potential Conflict adequately document that
no impairment will occur as a result of this change/transfer.
While this general aquifer does not qualify as the same body of public groundwater as the local aquifer of
origin under GWC-2844; under the policies and procedures of the Department of Ecology there is clearly a
continuity of waters, in at least one direction, relating the original POW with the proposed POW. This
combined analysis indicates that no impairment will occur as a result of approval of this proposed
Change/Transfer.
In summary, with knowledge of the hydrogeology of ground and surface waters involved, rights of record and
other pertinent data, it is concluded that the change/transfer requested will not impair existing water rights.
Public Interest.
Water right transfers are provided for by the State Water Code; and, standards have been set forth therein.
Subject application for change/transfer is consistent with public policy objectives of said Code and the
policies and administrative decisions derived from the Code and various Court interpretations thereof to
provide for the efficient use of water resources through the change/transfer of the terms of an existing water
right. There are no detrimental effects to the public interest associated with the requested transfer.

GWC20251 was issued to BN for 2,745 gpm up to 1,260 AF for up to 315 acres and has been apportioned based on 139 acres.
The Place of Use (POU) and Points of Withdrawal(s) (POW) are as indicated within data before the Franklin County Conservancy Board.
Bill Middleton proposes expedited completion of this project. Completion of Construction due by April 1,
2003 unless further extended for good cause. Proof of appropriation (for actual beneficial use of water) by
September 30, 2004 unless further extended for good cause.
The proposed schedule is suitable for accommodating orderly development, taking into account the type and
magnitude of the project. A proof inspection by the Department of Ecology is recommended for consideration
to certify actual development of the water right as changed/transferred.
No change/transfer of the priority date, acres irrigated, instantaneous quantity, net annual consumptive use
impact, or purpose of use is requested hereunder; therefore, the priority date, instantaneous quantity of
1,050 gpm, the 120 irrigated acres and purpose of use under GWC 2844 are not modified.
Findings.
1.
There is a water right eligible for change/transfer.
2.
The proposed change/transfer will not enlarge the right.
3.
The proposed change/transfer conforms to the criteria of continuity as between surface and
ground waters necessary and sufficient for approval of said proposal.
4.
The proposed change/transfer will not impair existing rights.
5.
Approval of the change/transfer will not be detrimental to the public interest.
In accordance with these Findings, the State Water Code, Rules, Policies and Procedures allow for approval of
the change/transfer per the application in the amounts and manner requested.
Recommendations
It is recommended that a Superseding Certificate order conditionally approving the requested
change/transfer be issued as described herein for GWC 2844:

PROVISIONS
In addition to provisions of the original GWC 2844, the following provision is recommended to apply to the
change/transfer authorization.
Completion of Construction (construction of well "A") shall be by April 1, 2003 unless further extended as
allowed by statute. Proof of Appropriation (full beneficial use of water) shall be by September 30, 2003
unless further extended as allowed by statute.
An approved measuring device shall be installed and maintained in accordance with RCW 90.03.360 or WAC
508-64-020 through WAC 508-54-040.
The amount of water granted is a maximum limit that shall not be exceeded and the water user shall be
entitled only to that amount or water within the specified limit that is beneficially used and required.
This authorization to make use of public waters of the state is subject to existing rights, including any existing
rights held by the United States for the benefit of Indians under treaty or otherwise.
A Superceding Certificate of water right will not be issued until a final examination is made.
Nothing in this authorization shall be construed as satisfying other applicable federal, state, or local statutes,
ordinances, or regulations.
Installation and maintenance of an access port as described in Ground Water Bulletin No. 1 is required. An
airline and gauge may be installed in addition to the access port.
All water wells constructed within the state shall meet the minimum standards for construction and
maintenance as provided under RCW 18.104 (Washington Water Well Construction Act of 1971) and Chapter
173-160 WAC (Minimum Standards for Construction and Maintenance of Water Wells).
A well log of the completed well shall be submitted by the driller to the Department of Ecology within thirty
(30) days of completion of well A. This well log shall be complete and all information concerning the static
water level in the completed well in addition to any pump test data shall be submitted as it is obtained.
The authorization to use public waters of the state, which is proposed hereunder, is not classified as a Family
Farm Development Permit under Chapter 90.66 RCW. The Applicant owns the new POU and the Applicant
has less than 6,000 acres of irrigated lands under ownership.
This is an agriculture-to-agriculture change with no change in the purpose of use.
