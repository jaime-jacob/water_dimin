REPORT
See WAC 173-153-130
BACKGROUND
An application for change/transfer of water right was filed with the Franklin
County Water Conservancy Board by Gerald Wolfley (Desert Estates Irrg.) of
Pasco, Washington on July 5, 2001. The application was accepted by the
conservancy board and public notice was made in accordance with RCW
90.03.280. No letters of protest or request for intervenor status were
received during the thirty day protest period. The following information was
obtained from the applicant, individuals with relevant personal knowledge,
review of Department of Ecology records, and analysis of pertinent data.
Certificate No. G3-24981C (B) issued January 15, 1986 with a priority date of
July 7, 1976; in the amounts of 400 gallons per minute (gpm) ; 160 acre-feet
per year (af/yr) for irrigation from January 1 through December 31 each year.
The certificate issued for one well site within the NW14 SE14 SE14 of Section
11, T. 9 N., R. 29 E.W.M. The permit authorized use within the following
place of use: SW14 SE1/4; St/2 NW14 SE14; and Wt/2 SE14 SE14 of Section 11, T. 9 N., R.
29 E.W.M., Franklin County."
INVESTIGATION
Requested Change/Transfer. The application for change/transfer proposes to
add 2.5 acres of irrigation to the current certificate and to add an
additional 20 acres to the area description where irrigation water may be
applied.
The transfer does not involve any increase in the amount of water pumped as
permitted under G3-24981C(B) The effect of the transfer will be to convert
from the irrigation of alfalfa to the irrigation of landscape areas within a
housing subdivision.
Permit 63 249810 issued conjan t, 1977 which Precedes the
Family Farm Act. The priority date of this certificate precedes the Family
Farm Act thus this action is exempt from any conditions relating to the
Family Farm Act.
Family Farm Act
8,1997
Demonstrated Use. The Department of Ecology performed a proof inspection in
March, 1985 and issued a certificate for G3-24981C (B) on January 15, 1986.
Aerial photography (attachment 1), satellite imagery (attachment 2), and the
applicants Report of Examination demonstrate that the certificate has been
utilized continuously since issuance of the certificate. The cropping
rotation/cycle identified by the applicant is 2 years alfalfa and 1 . year
potatoes. A field investigation conducted by Franklin County Water
Conservancy Board volunteer staff member Mark Nielson on August 1, 2001
confirmed active irrigation and thus beneficial use within the place of use.
Available Water for Transfer/Diminishment of Existing Certificate
The change/transfer diminishes the total quantity to be pumped because return
flows cannot be transferred (RCW 90.03.380). Return flows are characterized
in this circumstance as deep percolation of applied water as no flows are
returned directly to surface waters. Attachment 3 shows the calculations for
determining the available water for transfer per RCW 90.03.380. For purposes
of the change/transfe application, the valid, transferable right under
permit G3-24981C (B) is 400 gpm, 155.9 af/yr for irrigation from January 1
through December 31 each year.

Place of Use. The requested place of use is within the boundaries of the
City of Pasco. The site is zoned R-1-S (Suburban District) . The
Comprehensive Plan for Pasco designates this area and surrounding areas for
Single Family Residential development. With the increased difficulty in
obtaining water rights for municipal purposes, the City of Pasco encourages
a
separate irrigation system for lawns and landscaping and has made this a
condition for plat approval.
The 20 acres to be added to the area description where irrigation water may
be applied is currently vacant. Certificate G3-24981C(B) currently describes
81 acres where irrigation water. may be applied of which only 40 acres may be
irrigated. The change/transfer request describes a total of 101 acres where
irrigation water may be applied of which only 42.5 acres may be irrigated.
There are currently two state-issued water rights within the place of use;
certificate G3-24981A (C) which provides for irrigation of 8 acres within the
VW1 SE14 and W1/2 W12 SW14 SE14 of section 11, T. 9 N. R 29 E.W.M. ; and the
proposed certificate for change/transfer G3-24981C(B) There is no conflict
between the two certificates as the Department of Ecology has performed proof
inspections and issued certificates for both. There are no pending water
right applications within the place of use. Certificate G3-24981A (C) is
being put to beneficial use but the point of withdrawal is not consistent
with the existing certificate. It is suggested that Mr. Wolfley submit a
change application for G3-24981A(C) to address the inconsistency between the
current point of withdrawal and the existing certificate.
Impairment Analysis. The effect of the transfer is to add 2.5 acres of
irrigation to the existing certificate. Because of the reduction in
consumptive use by converting from irrigation of alfalfa to lawn and
Landscape, there will be no increase in the total water pumped. Because
return flows cannot be transferred, an actual reduction in the total water
pumped will occur.
The current well is a 10 inch diameter well with casing extending from 1'
above ground surface to 141.5' below ground surface (bgs) This well is
screened from 140'bgs to 151' bgs and pumps water from the Pasco Gravels
aquifer formation of the sedimentary aquifer. It has a static water level of
135 feet and has maintained this level during continual use since 1981. No
change in point of withdrawal is requested.
Research of state records shows that there are 11 state-issued water rights
within one mile of the current well site and Franklin Conservation District
records show 18 wells within one mile of the current well site. The nearest
water rights are for irrigation wells within section 11, T.9 N., R. 29 E.W.M.
The aquifer in this area is not experiencing water level declines, and there
are no known well interference problems in the area.
In summary, after review of the hydrogeology of the area, rights of record
and other pertinent data, it is concluded that the change/transfer requested
vill not impair existing water rights and will not adversely affect pending
applications.
Public Interest. Water right transfers are anticipated and provided for by
the state water code to accommodate modifications to existing water rights
which become necessary or desired in the course of developing a water use
project. The subject application for change/transfer is consistent with
public policy objectives of the Department of Ecology to provide for
efficient use of water resources and to encourage supply through transfer of
existing water rights. There are no detrimental effects to the public
interest associated with the requested transfer.
State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) The requested change/transfer
involves a water right modification in the amount of 400 gpm of groundwater.
Such an action falls under a categorical exemption to SEPA for water right
applications.
Special Conditions. The total usage under Certificate G3-24981C will be
Limited to a maximum of 400 gpm, 155.9 af/yr from the well.

Gerald Wolfley has proposed a development schedule for completing the
requested transfer of water right and proposes expedited completion in order
:O comply with diligence for the overall project.
Completion of Construction (construction of facilities for irrigation) due
June 1, 2005 unless further extended for good cause.
Proof of Appropriation (for actual beneficial use of water) due June 1,
008 unless further extended for good cause.
'he proposed schedule is suitable for accommodating orderly development,
taking into account the type and magnitude of the project. A proof
inspection by the Department of Ecology is recommended to certify actual
development of the water right as amended.
'he priority date, and purposes of use for the permit are not modified.
CONCLUSIONS
applications for change of water right permits and certificates are governed
y RCW 90.44.100, RCW 90.03.380 and RCW 90.80 (Conservancy Board
legislation) RCW 90.44 states in part that: the holder of a valid right to
withdraw public ground waters may, without losing his priority of right,
construct wells at a new location in substitution for, or in addition to,
hose at the original location, or he may change the manner or the place of
ise of the water; such amendment shall be issued by the department only on
he conditions that; (1) the additional or substitute well or wells shall tap
he same body of public ground water as the original well or wells; (2) use
f the original well or wells shall be discontinued upon construction of the
ubstitute well or wells; (3) the construction of an additional well or wells
hall not enlarge the right conveyed by the original permit or certificate;
nd (4) other existing rights shall not be impaired. The department may
pecify an approved manner of construction and shall require a showing of
compliance with the terms of the amendment.
'indings
There is a water right eligible for change/transfer.
The proposed change/transfer will not enlarge the right.
The proposed change/transfer will be for the same body of public
groundwater as the original permit.
The proposed change/transfer will not impair existing rights.
Approval of the change/transfer will not be detrimental to the public
interest.
according to these findings, state law allows for approval of the
change/transfer application in the amounts and manner requested.
RECOMMENDATIONS
t is recommended that a certificate order conditionally approving the
requested change/transfer, be issued as described herein.
