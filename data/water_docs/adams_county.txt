REPORT
RECORD OF DECISION & CERTIFICATE OF CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
This Record of Decision and Certificate of Conditional Approval is issued by the Water Conservancy Board of
Adams County pursuant to the provisions of Ch. 90.80 RCW and Ch. 173-153 WAC and consists of two elements:
(1) Record of Decision and (2) Certificate of Conditional Approval.
BACKGROUND
An application for change of place of use and change in point of withdrawal to Water Certificate 1000A was
submitted to the Department of Ecology by Bernard Erickson on July 23 1998. This pending application for
change was forwarded to the Adams County Water Conservancy Board as provided for under RCW 90.80 and
Chapter 173-153 WAC and is now the subject of this Record of Decision and Conditional Certificate.
This certificate of Water Right is issued in the amount of 325 gallons per minute, 320 acre feet per year for the
irrigation of 80 acres from a well located within the SE 1/4 NE 1/4 of sec. 6 T18 N, R32 E.W.M. The original
certificated place of use is the E 1/4 N 1/4 of sec. 6, T18N, R 32 E.W.M. The proposed new place of use will be 80
acres within the S 1/2 NE 1/4 sec.32 and the N 1/2 SE 1/4 sec.32, all within T19N, R31 E.W.M. in Adams County,
Washington. The proposed new point of withdrawal will be an existing well located within SW 1/4 NW 1/4 of sec.
31 T19 N, R31 E.W.M. in Adams County, Washington.
A notice of application was duly published in accordance with RCW 90.80.
Protestants or Interveners
This application for change was protested by Jake and Alice Weber on July 18, 2000 following the last date of
publication of the public notice and within the 30-day protest period as prescribed in the notice. The Webers stated
that their domestic, livestock and irrigation wells have been adversely affected by irrigation wells in the area.
The following information was given to Jake and Alice Weber during an investigative interview conducted on
August 17, 2000 by D.O.E. employees James Lyerla and Karen Tusa along with Adams County Water
Conservancy Board member Dennis E. Swinger.
The domestic well at their home is drilled to a depth of 556 feet below land surface. The pump was originally set
at 416 feet in 1980 and has since been lowered to 490 feet in 1997 and again to 530 in the summer of 2000. Prior
to re-setting the pump this well ran out of water during the summer in 1998 and 1999.
They used their irrigation well south of the freeway during the short time the well was dry to supply domestic and
stock water to the house. However, the well south of the freeway is also experiencing production problems. It
used to produce 2000 gallons per minute in 1974 and the production has dropped off to 500 gallons per minutes in
recent years. This well is 380 feet in depth and has not been re-drilled because the existing turbine pump was stuck
in the bottom of the well. The pump and column were removed in January of 2001.
The following is part of a technical report prepared by D.O.E. employee James Lyerla.
This well has been measured annually by the Department of Ecology and it appears that the static water levels have
declined from a static water level of 87 feel below land surface in 1975 to 213 feet below land surface in the year
2000. This is a 25-year period of record with an average decline of 5 fee per year. This decline is well within the
limits of 10 feet per years as defined in the Management Regulations for the Odessa Sub-area WAC 173-130A.
The Department measures the static water levels of 8 wells (including one of the protestants' irrigation wells)
within a 5-mile radius from his domestic well. Water levels in these 8 wells have declined less than 5 feet per year,
and in some instances, have no recorded declines over the period of record.
The Department does not take dynamic pumping measurements during the irrigation season, but it is likely that
these dynamic water levels are getting deeper each year during the pumping season due to additional stress on the
aquifer system as a result of deepening or reconstruction of existing irrigation wells and installation of larger
irrigation pumps. These irrigation wells are typically uncased and are completed into the Grande Ronde aquifer
system. The shallower water table common to the Wanapum aquifer system (which includes the upper portions of
the protestants' irrigation and domestic wells) is allowed to flow down the well bore continuously, thereby
lowering the water level in the Wanapum aquifer system. The bottom of the Wanapum formation is at 375 feet
ORIGINAL
Continued
below land surface in this area. De-watering of the Wanapum aquifer system is the primary cause of loss of water
in the Weber Wells and is exaggerated during the irrigation season due to pumping interference from deeper, large
capacity wells used for irrigation. The protestant's domestic well (556 feet deep) is completed into both the
Grande Ronde and Wanapum aquifer systems and the irrigation well south of the highway (371 feet deep) is
probably completed in the Wanapum aquifer system. In any case, these two wells are competing for the same
source of ground water that supplies the local, composite head, irrigation wells.
These wells are completed into both aquifer systems, typically being 900 to 1400 feet in depth. The applicant is
proposing to transfer the water right from an existing well located within the SE 1/4 NE 1/4 of Sec. 6, T. 18N, R. 32
E.W.M. to an existing well located within the SW1/4NW1/4 of Sec. 31, T. 19N., R 31 E.W.M. The well in Sec. 6
was drilled to a depth of 410 feet in 1950 and is completed into the top of the Grande Ronde formation. However,
at the time of drilling, this well displayed a static water level of 76 feet, which is typical of the Wanapum aquifer
system. The well in Sec. 31 was drilled in 1977 to a depth of 970 feet below land surface and is completed in both
the Grande Ronde and Wanapum aquifer systems. This is an uncased well with a static water level of 160 feet on
the date of drilling. The Department does not measure the water levels in either well and information on the static
water levels does not exist with the exception of the driller's reported static water levels. It is very likely that the
static water level in both of these wells dropped since they were drilled and is now much deeper as a result of local
irrigation pumping.
The Odessa computer model was used to evaluate the additional stress during the pumping season that the well at
the new location would have on the protestant's wells if this change in point of withdrawal and place of use were
issued. The well at the new location would be pumped at 325 gallons per minute, for an annual withdrawal of 200-
acre feet per year. The pumping stress in the model was limited to 200 acre feet per year as opposed to the 320
acre feet Certificated, because the Odessa Sub-area regulations limit the annual withdrawal of ground water to 2.5
acre feet per acre. The model predicted that in 3 years the additional decline in the protestant's wells would be .12
feet or approximately .04 feet per year.
It appears that declines in the protestant's wells will continue due to large-scale irrigation withdrawals in the area
and continual downhole flow in these uncased wells. It is only a matter of time before the protestant will be
required to deepen these wells in order to compete with the larger production irrigation wells. The additional
decline of 0.04 feet per year resulting from this change of point of withdrawal does not appear to be unreasonable
considering the historic declines recorded to date.
Verification of Existing Right and Water Use:
Victor Franz submitted a signed affidavit stating that he had irrigated all of this property prior to placing it in the
Conservation Reserve Program in 1987. Bernard Erickson submitted Seasonal Use and Point of Withdrawal
Changes issued by the Department of Ecology for each of the following years: 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001.
Copies of the Conservation Reserve Program contracts numbered 304 and 509 were submitted.
Compliance with State Environmental Policy Act:
This application is categorically exempt from the provisions of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) of
1971, Chapter 43.21C RCW. This application for change is exempt under the Family Farm Water Act of 1977,
Chapter 90.66 RCW.
INVESTIGATION
Field Examination for Existing Use and Site of Change/Transfer:
Dennis E. Swinger, Adams County Water Conservancy Board member and Bernard Erickson, applicant, conducted
a field examination of the irrigation facilities in sec. 30, 31, 32 and 33 T19N, R31E.W.M. Adams County Wa. On
January 10, 2001. A pumping station was observed with one main line supplying Bureau of Reclamation Water, a
deep well, a deep well turbine/ pump assembly, two booster pumps, two flow meters, various control panels,
miscellaneous valves and wiring and two parallel mainlines distributing water to eleven center pivot irrigation
systems of various sizes.
DOE employees James Lyerla and Karen Tusa along with Adams County Water Conservancy Board member
Dennis E. Swinger inspected the well site in Sec. 6 T. 18N, R32 E.W.M. Adams County, Washington on
August 17, 2000. An unused, uncapped well, a control panel, stacked column and drive shaft and miscellaneous
irrigation equipment were observed at this site.
The applicant owns and operates a farm that has 7 irrigation circles serviced with ground water and 4 irrigation
circles serviced with Bureau of Reclamation Water. This farm has parallel, but separate, transmission systems.
System number 1 supplies Bureau of Reclamation water to four of the circles. System number 2 supplies ground
water to six of the circles. Each system consists of separate pumps, control panels, meter, electric service,
underground delivery system and circles. No mixing of ground water and Bureau of Reclamation water takes
ORIGINAL

place. Existence of the parallel systems was verified by Terry Kilmer, the earth works contractor, and Lad
Irrigation, the materials and welding contractor. A map detailing the two systems was submitted. System number
1, Bureau of Reclamation water, has been inspected, approved and has been issued a service contract. The well
located in SW 1/4 NW 1/4 of Sec. 31. T19 N., R. 31 E.W.M. was drilled in 1977 to 970 feet with a diameter of 20
inches. The static water level in 2000 is unknown. The well is equipped with a 500 hp turbine pump, two 125 hp
booster pumps and a digital, differential pressure flow meter. This well is cased to 40 feet. A driller's well log for
both wells has been submitted.
Associated Water Rights and Uses Related to Current and Proposed Action(s):
The following Ground Water Certificates, (1) G3-21031-C, (2) G3-20795-C, and (3) 4370-B, held by the applicant,
have a common point of withdrawal, the well located in SW 1/4 NW 1/4 of Sec. 31 T. 19 N, R 31 E.W.M. Adams
County, Washington. A copy of each Ground Water Certificate has been submitted.
The following Ground Water Certificates, (1) 3335-A, (2) G3-01227C, and (3) G3-01228C, held by Gene Kagele
and Pattie Kagele Farms are used on a seasonal change basis to withdraw water from the well located in SW 1/4
NW 1/4 of Sec. 31 T 19 N, R 31 E.W.M. Adams County, Washington to supply the number 2 system, the Ground
Water system.
The applicant proposes to add Ground Water Certificate 1000A to the well located in SW 1/4 NW 1/4 of Sec. 31 T 19
N, R 31 E.W.M. Adams County, Washington to supply ground water to a circle located within the S 1/2 NE 1/4 Sec.
32, N 1/2 SE 1/4 Sec. 32 all within T19N, R 31 E.W.M. Adams County, Washington. No change in number 2
system, Ground water, will be required. The withdrawal, 325 gallons per minute and 320 acre feet per year as
authorized under Ground Water Certificate 1000A, is presently being withdrawn from an existing well located in
SW1/4NW1/4 of sec. 31 T 19N, R 31 E.W.M. Adams County, Washington to supply ground water under seasonal
changes. Total withdrawal shall be limited to 4 AF/yr or a total of 320 acre feet
CONCLUSIONS & CONDITIONAL DECISION
Victor Franz submitted a signed affidavit stating that he had irrigated all of this property prior to placing it in the
Conservation Reserve Program in 1987. Bernard Erickson submitted Seasonal Use and Point of Withdrawal Changes
issued by the Department of Ecology for each of the following years: 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. Copies of the
Conservation Reserve Program contracts numbered 304 and 509 were submitted.
The technical report prepared by D.O. E. employee James Lyerla indicated that no impairment or encumbrances,
beyond the Odessa Sub-Aquifer Management Rules will be imposed on area wells by this change.
Recommendations
This application for change of point of withdrawal, and place of use of 325 gpm and up to 320 acre-feet per year
should be approved subject to the following provisions:
Provisions
"Use of water under this authorization shall be contingent upon the water right holder's utilization of up to date
water conservation practices and maintenance of efficient water delivery systems consistent with established
regulation requirements and facility capabilities."
"A superseding Certificate of water right will not be issued until a final examination is made."
"Nothing in this authorization shall be construed as satisfying other applicable federal, state, or local statues,
ordinances, or regulations."
"An approved measuring device shall be installed and maintained in accordance with TCW 90.03.360 and/or WAC
508-64-020 through WAC 508-64-040." (Installation, operation and maintenance requirements attached hereto)."
"The amount of water granted is a maximum limit that shall not be exceeded and the water user shall be entitled
only to that amount of water within the specified limit that is beneficially used and required for the actual crop
grown on the number of acres and the place of use specified."
"The water source and/or water transmission facilities are not wholly located upon the land owned by the
applicant. Issuance of a permit by this Department for appropriation of the waters in question does not convey a
right of access to, or other right to use, land which the applicant does not legally possess. Obtainment of such right
is a private matter between applicant and owner of that land."
"This authorization to make use of public waters of the State is subject to existing rights, including any existing
rights held by the Untied /states for the benefit of Indians under treaty or otherwise."
ORIGINAL
Continued
"All water wells constructed within the State shall meet the minimum standards for construction and maintenance
as provided under RCW 18.104 (Washington Water Well Construction Act of 1971) and Chapter 173-160-285
(Minimum Standards for Construction and Maintenance of Water Wells)."
The Adams County Water Conservancy Board hereby accepts conditional approval for the water right
change/transfer described within this record of decision and submits this certificate and record of decision for
conditional approval to the Director of the Washington State Department of Ecology for final review.
